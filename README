- Use left and right arrow keys to move the falling tetrominos

- Up arrow rotates falling piece, down arrow increases speed of falling block

- Spacebar will immediately drop falling piece to lowest possible position

- Filling an entire row will clear that line and cause pieces above to fall

- The more lines cleared at one time, the more points the player earns

- As more lines are cleared, the game speed will increase 

- Game ends when user reaches the top of the screen and is unable to move anymore pieces

- Users are then prompted on whether they wish to try again or close the game
